# Website Uptime Monitor Action

A GitHub Action that monitors websites' uptime, logs results, and creates issues when sites are down. All managed entirely within your GitHub repository, with no external servers or cloud services required.

## Features

- ✅ Monitor multiple websites concurrently
- 📊 Log response times and status codes
- 🚨 Automatically create GitHub issues for failures
- 🌍 Timezone-aware timestamps
- ⚙️ Configurable timeouts and success codes
- 📝 Commit logs back to repository

## Troubleshooting & FAQs


### Q: Why isn’t my log file committing?

Ensure your workflow declares:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
Verify log-file is a path within the repository and not excluded by .gitignore.

---

### Q: My job hung or ran past the expected time.

Add a timeout-minutes: under your job to cap total runtime:

```yaml
jobs:
  uptime-check:
    timeout-minutes: 20
```
Try lowering the `timeout` value (in seconds) or reducing `max-concurrent` to avoid long-running or overlapping fetch requests.

---

### Q: How do I skip issue creation but still log failures?

Set `create-issue: "false"` in your step’s `with:` block. The log will still record failures, but no issue will be opened.

---

### Q: I get network or DNS errors for some URLs.

The action treats a failed fetch() as status 0 and logs “Error: Timeout” or the exception message.

You can adjust timeout (e.g. 5 seconds) or disable issue creation for noisy endpoints.

---

### Q: My configured success-codes aren’t recognized.

Provide a comma-separated list without spaces, e.g. "200,204,301".

The action parses each code with parseInt; invalid entries are ignored.

---

### Q: I’m not receiving email notifications when the action creates an issue.

The action opens issues using the GITHUB_TOKEN, so they’re authored by the GitHub Actions bot and you won’t be notified unless you’re subscribed to issue events or participate in the thread.

To receive emails for new issues, go to your repository, click Watch > Custom, select Issues, and then Apply. Once subscribed, you’ll get an email each time the action generates an issue.

---

### Q: I see a 6-hour job timeout error.

By default, GitHub cancels jobs after 6 hours. Use timeout-minutes: X in your workflow to shorten this and avoid runaway bills.
