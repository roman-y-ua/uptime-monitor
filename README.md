# Website Uptime Monitor Action

A GitHub Action that monitors websites' uptime, logs results, and creates issues when sites are down. All managed entirely within your GitHub repository, with no external servers or cloud services required.

## Features

- ✅ Monitor multiple websites concurrently
- 📊 Log response times and status codes
- 🚨 Automatically create GitHub issues for failures
- 🌍 Timezone-aware timestamps
- ⚙️ Configurable timeouts and success codes
- 📝 Commit logs back to repository

## Troubleshooting & FAQs


### Q: Why isn’t my log file committing?

Ensure your workflow declares:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
Verify log-file is a path within the repository and not excluded by .gitignore.

---

### Q: My job hung or ran past the expected time.

Add a timeout-minutes: under your job to cap total runtime:

```yaml
jobs:
  uptime-check:
    timeout-minutes: 20
```
Try lowering the `timeout` value (in seconds) or reducing `max-concurrent` to avoid long-running or overlapping fetch requests.

---

### Q: How do I skip issue creation but still log failures?

Set `create-issue: "false"` in your step’s `with:` block. The log will still record failures, but no issue will be opened.

---

### Q: I get network or DNS errors for some URLs.

The action treats a failed fetch() as status 0 and logs “Error: Timeout” or the exception message.

You can adjust timeout (e.g. 5 seconds) or disable issue creation for noisy endpoints.

---

### Q: My configured success-codes aren’t recognized.

Provide a comma-separated list without spaces, e.g. "200,204,301".

The action parses each code with parseInt; invalid entries are ignored.

---

### Q: I see a 6-hour job timeout error.

By default, GitHub cancels jobs after 6 hours. Use timeout-minutes: X in your workflow to shorten this and avoid runaway bills.
